# Analysing borrowers' credit Rrepayment behaviour 

The goal is to find out whether the factors such as the marital status and the number of children of the borrowers affect the repayment of the loan to the bank on time. The Bank X has provided the data on clients' creditworthiness.

Tools used:
Pandas, pymystem3

*Conclusion:* borrowers' marital status and number of children don't have a significant impact on whether they will default on a loan, and the ratio doesn't exceed 3.77% for marital status and 1.73% for the number of children.
